<h1>Career Counselling</h1>

<h2>Why Career counselling?</h2>
<p>
  The student community faces considerable confusion with regard to choice of
  courses that would lead them to successful careers. A lot of time and money is
  spent to prepare a concrete base for one's career by taking relevant courses.
  In case the student chooses a profession, which doesn't match his personality
  or intelligence, or in areas he/she is not interested, then all his/her
  preparation would be a waste and he/she may end up as a poor performer and
  with no job satisfaction.
</p>
<hr />
<h2>What is Career Counselling?</h2>
<p>
  Career Counselling is guidance provided by qualified professionals, after
  assessing the intelligence, interest and personality of an individual to
  identify the careers in which the individual will succeed and counsel him/her
  accordingly. It helps students to select courses based on their level of
  intelligence, interests, personality and to prepare for appropriate careers.
</p>
<p>
  Our Counselors (you can call/meet for counseling every day( Time 12:00 to
  1:00) and you can also visit School of Computer Science & Information
  Technology, DAVV Indore same time. )
