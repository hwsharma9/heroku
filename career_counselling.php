                        The student community faces considerable confusion with regard to choice of
                        courses that would lead them to successful careers. A lot of time and money is
                        spent to prepare a concrete base for one's career by taking relevant courses.
                        In case the student chooses a profession, which doesn't match his personality
                        or intelligence, or in areas he/she is not interested, then all his/her
                        preparation would be a waste and he/she may end up as a poor performer and
                        with no job satisfaction.
