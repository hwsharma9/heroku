                        meritorious but cannot afford higher education. Under this scheme, a student
                        who wishes to earn along with their studies could work for 4 hours a day in
                        the school. The students enrolled under the scheme are assigned various

                        themselves better for taking up jobs in future. It is also helpful for
                        preventing candidates from distractions and engage them in meaningful and
                        positive activities. This scheme enables meritorious and needy students to
                        earn a reasonable amount every month to meet their expenses.
