                    <h1>Why Recruit Our Students?</h1>
                    <p>Warm greetings on behalf of School of Computer Science & IT, Devi Ahilya University, Indore. Our
                        School was established in 1986 and since then it has endeavored into promoting technical
                        education and research in the important and fast growing branches of Computer Science and
                        Information Technology. We are a University Teaching Department under Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya with
                        its goal to produce computer science specialists who can meet the global challenges. The School
                        has highly experienced faculty members, modern laboratories, building infrastructure equipped
                        with ICT and library. Our teaching learning process focuses on the enrichment of analytical skills, 
                        problem solving and communication skills of students.  </p> <br>

                        <p> School of Computer Science & IT followed best academic practices. Students are
                        groomed up not only in the theoretical foundation of the subject but are required to learn
                        through practical training. Theory is complemented by practical's and projects. Internship and minor/ major projects are
                        compulsory component of every programme. Many of the projects are carried out for local entrepreneurs in a team which enable the team building spirits among students and prepare them for working in cross cultural environments. 
                        Our M.Tech students undertake projects from several reputed organization such as RR CAT Indore, Soyabean Research Center Indore, DRDO, NTPC, C-DAC, ST Microelectronics, ISRO etc., and private software companies.  We focus on developing problem solving skills in
                        students. We regularly organize skill development courses, workshops and
                        seminars that help to make students industry ready. We also encourage our students to follow social norms and IT ethics.
